# Talking points/general tasks for assignment planning

* Travis: Do we want to use it?
** My gut impression: shouldn't be too hard to get going, so why not?
* Gradle: Get it up and running
* Implementation:
** Stick with vanilla javafx or go with spring?
*** my gut says go with javafx - I think it'll cost us more than the 2.5% to use Spring or Android tools
** MVC vs MVP
*** Come up with a short model using each and pick the one better suited
*** make sure to include how the observer, mediator patterns fit in, if they do.
* Responsibilities: Who wants to focus more heavily on what?

*  The BEC student meeting rooms are bookable and have a big screen and whiteboard, plus they're private. They do have to be booked the day before (or earlier) though. That might be a good place to work on this.
